                <p>My first project was for a friend of my wife, they ran JADE Realty Group, Inc. I started out helping setup their computer system, network and accounting software. Their acconting software was not designed for property management so I created a custom database application for them. Their website was my first venture into web design.</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Next came Half Pint Ranch. My neighbor and best friend moved back to his home state of Colorado where he bought a 65-acre ranch east of Denver. He raised miniature Hereford cattle, goats, sheep, chickens and a few pigs. I built his website HalfPintRanch.com to advertise his cattle, goat milk & cheese and fresh eggs. </p>

                <p>I currently volunteer for the Orlando Ski and Travel Club as their webmaster. They use Wild Apricot, a membership management software. Wild Apricot host their website and provides a WYSIWYG editor. I use HTML and CSS to improve and add features.</p>
